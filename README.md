# The Cage
The Cage is a first-person puzzle game with horror elements. The game is made on Unreal Engine 4.27. The project is written on Blueprints.

The idea of the game is to open the gate and get out of the trap. The first note explains the main task of the game. The player must find the code for the lock; the key for the gate is hidden in a locked chest. The level consists of two floors. On the first floor, the player gets acquainted with the mechanics of the game. On the second floor, there are the AI enemies and the password to the lock. Enemies cannot enter the first floor until the player opens the door. The second floor consists of two sections. Each section has a certain number of rooms. The player climbs to the second floor and tries to find the password inconspicuously. If the AI enemy notices the player, it starts chasing him. The game ends if the enemy catches the player. The enemy immediately grabs and kills the player. It is almost impossible to complete the game in one go, so the player goes through several cycles of deaths and rebirths until he collects all parts of the password. When the player finally enters the password and the lock opens, the doors to the second floor also open automatically. Therefore, even if the player enters the password after respawning, he still has to rush to the gate to escape.
